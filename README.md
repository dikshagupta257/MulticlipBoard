# MulticlipBoard
This project is using shelve module, pyperclip module and sys module.
Say you have the boring task of filling out many forms in a web page or software with several text fields. The  clipboard saves you from typing the same text over and over again. But only one thing can be on the clipboard at a time. It  will save each piece of clipboard text under a keyword. This text can later be loaded to the clipboard again by the assigned  keyword. And if the user forgets what keywords they have, they can run the program to copy a list of all keywords to the  clipboard.
